# Sorting Visualiser

Welcome to my Sorting Visualiser, this project was made in the first year of my computer science degree to help me gain an understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while learning about how sorting algorithms work along with their time complexities.
This is a website that helps visualise how sorting algorithms work.

## Features

The website can generate an array of specified length with random values along with the graphical representation of the array in the form of bars.
Some of the popular sorting algorithms can be visualised using the website.

## Technologies

The technologies used are listed below
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (VanillaJS)

## How to Use

To use this website, you can visite this url [non-existent] or clone the repository via Github.

## Credits

This project was largely self implemented with little to no reference to other sorting visualisers. This was done as an attempt to use my own implementation of a sorting visualiser as a learning excercise.
